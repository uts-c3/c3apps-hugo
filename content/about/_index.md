## About us

### Our Mission

World-class scholarly pursuit to advance knowledge of plant-microbe ecosystem resilience and adaptation to a changing climate.
Provide integrated and collaborative scientific research, together with dynamic interactions with industry and world-class technology, to deliver innovative solutions to progress Australia’s bioeconomy.

### Our Approach

The Climate Change Cluster (C3) undertakes integrated and interdisciplinary research at the intersection of the Physical and Life Sciences. The institute’s goal is to deliver meaningful, impactful research to inform solutions to mitigate climate change impacts on our plant-microbe ecosystems, which are critical for the well-being of the animals, plants and our communities that rely on them. C3’s research therefore, is making contributions to address the biggest environmental and societal issues facing Australia and other countries in a changing climate: food and energy security; sustainability and ecological resilience; and global health.

C3 has been delivering research excellence in catagory-1 grants since 2008  and has now reached the size and scale to be a nationally recognised research cluster with sufficient breadth of skill to enable it to expand into areas with an industry focus, in particular to support Australia’s emerging bio-economy.
